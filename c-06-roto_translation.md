## Roto-Translation Covariant Convolutional Networks for Medical Image Analysis(2018)

SE(2) group convolutions, extend from G-CNN

There is no need for data augmentation by rotation and the kernel weights(that no longer need to learn rotation covariance) become available
to increase the CNNs expresive capacity.

### Dataset
AMIDAN

### Evaluation
We assessed an F1-score for each model based on the 11 test cases(533 mitosis)
in the conditions of \[14]
