## Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection

We discover that the extreme foreground-background class imbalance encountered during training of dense detectors is the central cause

In contrast,rather than addressing outliers, our focal loss is designed
to address class imbalance by down-weighting inliers (easy
examples) such that their contribution to the total loss is
small even if their number is large.
