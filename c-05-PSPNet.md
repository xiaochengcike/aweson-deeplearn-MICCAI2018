## Pyramid Scene Parsing Network

### a superior framework for pixel level prediction
major issue is to utilize global scene category clues

### Contributions
(1) We develop an effective optimization strategy for deep
ResNet based on deeply supervised loss.

(2) We propose a pyramid scene parsing network to embed
difficult scenery context features in an FCN based
pixel prediction framework.
